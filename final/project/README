 *  Final Project Golden Gate Bridge
 *  Jeremy Udis Graphics
 *
 *  A few things I'd like to point out: I used blending to make to water transparent. If you press
 *  the arrow key down and go under water you can see the detail of the support beams underneath the   *     bridge.
 *  I also modified the texture coords to give the effect that the water is moving. In addition, I added
 *  cars on the bridge. I also used blending to represent the windsheild+hatch. If you press the r key, it *  determines if the cars move. I added a 'car perspective'
 *  which puts the user in the perspective of the car(to do this press '1', to go back to default view,  *  press '2').
 *  To do the prior 2 tasks I used the time elasped method. The suspension cables were created by plotting *  points for a parabola
 *  and drawing many cylinders in between them.      
 *
 *  Key bindings:
 *  l          Toggle lighting on/off
 *  t          Change textures
 *  r          Toggle between moving and non moving cars
 *  1          Enter first person 'car' mode
 *  2          Enter perspective mode(default)
 *  a/A        decrease/increase ambient light
 *  d/D        decrease/increase diffuse light
 *  s/S        decrease/increase specular light
 *  e/E        decrease/increase emitted light
 *  n/N        Decrease/increase shininess
 *  []         Lower/rise light
 *  x          Toggle axes
 *  arrows     Change view angle
 *  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
 *  0          Reset view angle
 *  ESC        Exit
