 *  y/Y        Increase/decrease mandelbrot Y-value
 *  z/Z        Zoom in/out of mandelbrot
 *  o/O        Cycle through objects
 *  p/P        Toggle between orthogonal & perspective projections
 *  s/S        Start/stop light movement
 *  -/+        Decrease/increase light elevation
 *  a          Toggle axes
