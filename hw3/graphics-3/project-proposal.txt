My goal is to create a scene using OpenGL of various landmarks around the world. An example of such a structure would be the golden gate bridge or the parthenon in Athens. In particular, I will draw 3D objects 
that try to emulate the places I've traveled to; the places that resonate with my personal experieces.  

The scene will contain many of these landmarks scattered around. The user will be able to traverse the scene in first person or from a distance. 

I will create all of the objects myself in the source code. I will use textures to add realism to the scene. In addition, I will use lighting to add contrast and perspective. I will add multiple features each structures environment such as fog to the golden gate bridge/ferry building 

In addition the landmark itself I will add a small piece of the surrounding environment. For example, I will add
