HW1: Lorenz Attractor 

Jeremy Udis
CSCI4229/5229 Summer 2016

Display the Lorenz attractor in 3D. Parameters include r,s,b,w. They must all be positive. I chose to
perform 10,000 iterations of the Lorenz equations rather than 50,000 because the image produced using 10,000
iterations was of better quality, in my opinion. The parameters are displayed on the bottom of the window so your changes to them in real time. When I ran the program on my Mac, the deprecated warnings would NOT be surpressed.
